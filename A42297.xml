            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>TO Enumerate the Secret Plots, Publick Cruelties, and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Conſpiracies of our Indefatigable Enemies, the Papiſts, would be a labour as unneceſſary, as their Contrivances are endleſs: Thoſe, as they are the Deſign of Ages, would be the Subject of Volumns, being not able to be comprehended in ſo narrow a Circumference, as the following Narration. As for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>

The Violence of the Rabble at St. <hi>Jones</hi>'s exceeding even the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence of the Tumults ſo much exclaimed at by the <hi>Royal Martyr,</hi> and of as fatal Conſequence, as it is the dreadful Object of our Eyes, ſo it is the Subject of our preſent Diſcourſe, which is a True and Genuine Account of all the Secret Plots, Machines, and Bloody En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines, which are pretended to be diſcovered by the <hi>Rabble</hi> in the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Chappel, their unreaſonable Grounds and Jealouſies, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable Fate, which generally attend ſuch Raſh and Precipitous Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings.</p>
            <p>This Indigeſted Lump, the <hi>Rabble,</hi> animated by ſome Zealous Whiſperers, made their firſt Approaches on <hi>Sunday</hi> Morning, the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Inſtant at St. <hi>Jones</hi>'s, reſolving to pull down the Chappel of the <hi>Benedictines</hi> there, newly Erected in the Lord <hi>Bertlett</hi>'s Houſe: This Celebrated Structure, which at preſent conſiſted but of two Perſons and Servants, was deſigned for a Convent, which ought rather to be a Wall of Defence againſt their Aſſaults, than an In-let to the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. In all Ages the Temples of the Gods were in great Veneration, and <hi>Cyrus</hi>'s attempt, to rob the Temple of <hi>Jupeter Ammon,</hi> was but the loſs of the Sacrilegious Undertakers, who lay buried in the Ruines; but theſe Faries, or rather Furies of the Night, yet more audaucious, aſſault the Gates, and the Knot, which like <hi>Alexander,</hi> they could not with eaſe untie, with Violence cut, having forced their Paſſage through the Tyles and Glaſs and VVindows; after which they diſcovered ſeveral terrible Engines, which were enough to ſcare Men of the greateſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution and Conduct, out of their Seven Senſes. For Example.</p>
            <list>
               <item>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Three large Caldrons, or Boylers, of ſuch prodigious Depth and Circumference, that they could eaſily boyl a Thouſand Hereticks in it at one time, and not one of them hear the other cry.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>Secondly, Grid-Irons,</hi> as large as the <hi>Bowlling-Green</hi> at <hi>Mary-Bone,</hi> ſo that Four ſeveral Companies, one at every Corner, beſides Two in the Midle, might fry all Day as patienrly, as St. <hi>Lawrence,</hi> without diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing one another.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Several <hi>Iron Spits</hi> of a vaſt Extent, ſome as long, as the <hi>May-Pole</hi> in the <hi>Strand,</hi> others at the <hi>Main-Maſt</hi> of the <hi>Royal Soveraign,</hi> where <hi>Diſſenters</hi> might roaſt in Couples, as quietly as Cas'd Rabbets.</item>

                  <hi>Fourth. A</hi> Vault, which reached from the ſaid Popiſh Chappel, as far as <hi>Chick-lane,</hi> in which were diſcovered (by an Eye of Providence to the blind Rabble) <hi>Guido Faux</hi> with his Dark Lanthorn, Martialling his dreaeful Artillery of Gun-powder Matches, and Fire-Balls, which was far more formidable than a Gun-powder Plot, to blow up the Lord and Commons of the Rabble, that ſat Triumphant on the Roof of the Houſe.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>Fifth. As</hi> many Cart Loads of Links, as would ſerve to convey the Kings Carriages into the <hi>Weſt:</hi> Theſe were deſtin'd (by way of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite Torture) for Hereticks, to extort Confeſſion placeing them lighted under their Feet, Arms, Hands and Thighes, like the Saints formerly at <hi>Amboyna,</hi> though others believe they were rather Sauſages to tye about the Diſſenters while they were Roaſting upon the Spits.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>Sixth.</hi> Several Hundreds of Chopping Knives, and other Engines to reduce the Revertion into Minced meat, to make a <hi>Ragoo.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>Theſe with many others, as Iron VVhips, Rods of Steel, and Cats with Nine Tayles (no leſs terrible than thoſe of a <hi>Spaniſh Armado</hi>) were Diſcovered in this Chappel by the ſhort ſighted Rabble, who ſee all things double, and yet can diſcern no further then they can throw a Mill-ſtone.</p>
            <p>No matter; a Plot's Diſcover'd, and the Conſpirators muſt ſuffer, right or wrong: The next day being <hi>Monday,</hi> the Second Aſſault was made which proved more fatal; the Trained Bands and Guards being ſcarce able to ſuppreſs their Fury, till ſome of them fell a juſt Sacrifice to the defending Party; ſome Deſperadoes were killed in the Attempt, and many of the Guards wounded by the Rabble; nor did their Fury end here, but Order was given for the removing of the Goods which were conveyed away by the Guards to keep off the encroaching Aſſailants, yet this was not done ſo cloſely, but that the Rabble ſeized upon ſome Carts, out of which taking all the Goods, they made a Bone-fire in <hi>Holborn,</hi> without diſtinction; having no more mercy for an Holy Relique, than Sir <hi>VVilliam VValler</hi> for a Crucifix.</p>
            <p>Thus far the Violence and Groundleſs Jealouſies of the Rabble tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported them beyond all degrees of Report or Reaſon: It is now our Province to unriddle this Sphinx and ſhew in ſhort upon what ſlender ſuggeſtions they laid the Foundation of all theſe Tumults.</p>
            <p>As for the Chaldrons, there was indeed one ſmall Boyler which was no more than of a common ſize, a ſuch as is made uſe of for the

ordinary Service of a Family. Another ſmall one there was for the ſame Uſe, in a New Houſe adjoyning, and a Thi<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d, which was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what larger which belonged to the Lord <hi>Bertlet</hi>'s Family, when he kept a Bagnio in his Houſe, which being old and of no uſe, was laid in a low Room, into which they threw all their old Lead, Iron; and Lumber in the repairing of the Houſe.</p>
            <p>One <hi>Grid-Iron</hi> indeed there was; but of a very ſmall ſize, and very unfit for the uſe the Rabble pretended. The ground of this Suſpition, (and what might give ſome Cauſe to the deluded Multitude) was, that there were found in the Cellar, Two <hi>Iron VVindow Frames,</hi> which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly belonged to my Lord <hi>Bertlett,</hi> and of no other Uſe, but as Old Iron.</p>
            <p>There were alſo, a Couple of <hi>Spits;</hi> but of no other Size, or Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; but ſuch as are commonly uſed in a Family.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Links,</hi> or <hi>Flambeaus,</hi> there were never yet, Two in the Houſe at one time.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Vaults,</hi> and <hi>Barrels</hi> of <hi>Gun Powder;</hi> they are like the Blank Commiſſions, or the Doctors Black-Bills, or Army of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Pilgrims hid under Ground.</p>
            <p>By this ſhort Narrative, you may diſcern, to what deſperate Attempts, and on what Groundleſs Occaſions, the Fury of an incens'd Rabble will tranſport them. All Ages afford us ſad Inſtances, even before the bold <hi>Maſſaliano</hi> to our own Days; who, from ſo ſmall a Number at firſt, often bring a whole Land to Deſolation, if not timely prevented? which cannot better be done, than by obſerving the Wiſe Rules, and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Conduct of our Chief Magiſtrate, and Court of Aldermen; who, upon the like Diſturbances, have made an Act of Common Councel, ſtrictly injoyning all Maſters of Families upon Penalty to keep in their Servants upon ſuch an Occaſion, for by preventing the Cauſe, the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects may ceaſe.</p>
